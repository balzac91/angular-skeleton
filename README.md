# Angular Skeleton

[![Software License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](LICENSE)

Simple [AngularJS] (https://angularjs.org/) template for web apps. It contains all necessary tools you need to build and maintain web application based on Angular 1.x. [Gulp] (http://gulpjs.com/) provides easy way to automate popular tasks such as less compilation, minifying scripts and styles etc. All app dependencies are installed with [Bower] (http://bower.io/).  

This skeleton uses the following libraries and frameworks:
* [AngularJS] (https://angularjs.org/)
* [AngularUI Router] (https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router)
* [Bootstrap] (http://getbootstrap.com/)
* [UI Bootstrap] (https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/)
* [Font Awesome] (https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)

## Getting started
* Download or clone this repository
* Install dependencies with `npm install` - it automatically runs `bower install`

After installation you can start to develop the application. Just run `npm run serve` or `gulp serve` to start development server. It compiles less into css file and lints JS files using [ESLint] (http://eslint.org/).
To build minified app call `npm run build` or `gulp build`. It creates dist directory containing all the files needed for your application.
